Please say how to run your project:
After you open the web, you can begin by entering "start".
You can check the rooms' exits and contents by entering "look".
eg. You can go to the East by entering "East" or "e".

The rooms in my game are arranged as below

                                       North

                                       Bedroom
                              (Pansy of perplexity liquid)


West        Study                   Living room                       Corridor C                        lobby
        (Dog and sword)             (old man)                        (Thief's possible location)        (lock, exit, the tardis)


                                    Corridor B
                                    (Thief's possible location)

       Black market                Corridor A
       (Buy potion here)           (Thief's possible location)


                                     Base
                                    (Player's initial location)


The goal of the player is to get out of the house. The only exit of the house is at the lobby. However, there is a lock
on the door. You need to say the correct password to unlock the door. Only the old man in the living room knows the password.
After you talk to the old man, the time bomb is activated: you need to kill the thief and bring back the old man's gold within 12 hours.
Otherwise, you will be imprisoned by the old man (Game over).

In order to kill the thief, you need to find a sword. There is a sword
at the study, but you can't just take it easily because there is a huge dog guarding the sword.
You can buy potion from the black market and use the potion on the dog. Then you can take the sword at the study.

After you get the sword, wait for the thief to show up in one of the three corridors, and use the sword on the thief.
You can take the stolen items from the thief's bag after you kill thief. Then, give the gold to the old man. You can
talk to the old man again after that and get the password for the lock.

Lastly, say the password to the lock and get out of the house.

Some rooms are dark, you need to use match if you want to look around.
You can find the "pansy of perplexity" liquid at the bedroom. After taking it and then using it, your command for direction
will be replaced by one of the possible exits of your current room.
