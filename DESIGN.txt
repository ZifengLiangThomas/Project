you can't know the contents and exits by entering "look".

If you have matches in your inventory,
you can use them by entering "use match."
Then, you will be able to look around the dark room for a while.
After a few commands, the match will burn out. You need to use
another match to light up the room.

I will add {point : 0 } into my json world, the player can gain
points by successfully lighting up the dark room or using items on
certain targets.

position. When the player has the same position as the seller, the player
can talk to the seller and use money on the seller to buy certain things like
"potion" or "match". The thief will steal the player's money and the items
in his inventory, if they are in the same room.

resulting in the loss of player's ability to use "look" and to tell the directions of exits.
The player will gain his ability back after certain amount of commands or using potions.

    I will put the flower in a room. Once the player looks at, his commands for
    directions will be disoriented.






Week 10

I will add a item object which contains itemName and location.
If the player's position matches the items'location and enter something like "take",
the item jobject and the character inventory jobject will be updated.

2. Clock
I will also add a clock object to my json file.
I will connect the time-increment function with other operations by using monads,
such that each operation taken will increment the clock by 1.

-The time bomb
When the clock-value reaches certain amount, the time bomb explodes,
resulting in the loss of player's ability to use "look" and to tell the directions of exits.
The player will gain his ability back after
certain amount of commands or using potions.

in his inventory, if they are in the same room.
The sellers can sell weapons and potions to the player such that
he could beat the thief or other opponents.

4 Darkness and matches
There will be certain rooms that have the property "darkness".
In those rooms, the player can't tell the
directions of exits, use "look", or talk to the NPC. He has to use money to buy matches or torches
to do those certain things.
